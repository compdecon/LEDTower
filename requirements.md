# Requirements for Arduino/ESP32 based LED Tower

Q: I want you to work as a Arduino code developer for an ESP32 board.

A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you generate code for an ESP32 board. Please let me know the specific requirements and functionalities you want to implement in the ESP32 board.

The ESP32 is a very versatile microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it a great choice for a wide variety of IoT projects. It's important to note that while I can help generate and troubleshoot code, you'll need to do the actual implementation on your end since I cannot physically interact with the hardware.

A: As the end user I want the R/Y/G/B LED Tower to be used to indicate information about on going events. I want the LEDS to be able to slow flash on and off or fast flash on and off or fade from off to on back to on or 

- ESP32
  - GPIO 4 - Red
  - GPIO 5 - Yellow
  - GPIO 6 - Green
  - GPIO 7 - Blue
- Arduino enviroment
- MQTT
  - accept command strings from the device/cmd topic
    - coomands are in the format of "color cmd"
      - where command is:
        - on
        - off
        - fflash (fast flash)
        - sflash (slow flash)
      - where color is
        - red
        - green
        - yellow
        - blue
      - addition commands:
        - all off
        - all on
      - commands can be issued asynchronously
  - states can be monitored on device/state
- Flash fast
- Flash slow
- Fade on and off

I'll put a transcript into another file.
